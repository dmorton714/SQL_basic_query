# SQL Project with Python and Pandas
This project showcases the use of SQL in conjunction with Python and Pandas to perform SQLite queries and joins. It demonstrates your understanding of SQL concepts and your ability to leverage Python and Pandas to manipulate and analyze data using SQL operations. The notebooks where origanally developed for students I mentored at Code Louisville.The repo can be found here: *https://github.com/dmorton714/data-2-demo.git*

## Project Description
